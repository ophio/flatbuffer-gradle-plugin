This grade plugin has been developed in order to make the usage of [`FlatBuffers`](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers)easier. Big thanks to [`@nabil_hachicha`](https://twitter.com/nabil_hachicha) for his [talk](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/5984-build-your-gradle-plugin#video) at DroidCon London 2014.

## About
`FlatBuffers` format has been shown to give better results than JSON parsing. For more details about it read this [article](https://code.facebook.com/posts/872547912839369/improving-facebook-s-performance-on-android-with-flatbuffers/). For a more detailed introduction on how to use `FlatBuffers` you can have a look at this [article](https://code.facebook.com/posts/872547912839369/improving-facebook-s-performance-on-android-with-flatbuffers/). 

You may notice that the java files generation task could be difficult if there are frequent changes to the schema while developing. A solution for continuous generation of the java classes is needed. We have integrated the continuos generation of java file with the grade plugin. Whenever you make any changes to the input schema file, updated files will be generated upon the next grade build.

## Setup

1. Clone the `FlatBuffer`[repository](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers). 
2. Open the Xcode project: [`build/Xcode/FlatBuffers.xcodeproj`](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/tree/master/build/Xcode/FlatBuffers.xcodeproj). Alternatively you can generate your **flatc** executable using any other way (or if you are not using a Mac) as described [here](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/index.html).
3. Run the project using the Play Button or `âŒ˜ + R`, you will find the **flatc** executable in the project root directory.
4. Create a schema file for your project, you can find information on how to create [here](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/md__schemas.html).
5. Use the plugin. Change the schema and see the effect. Enjoy!

## Usage

[`flatbuffer-gradle-plugin`](plugin/) has been uploaded on [bintray](https://bintray.com/ophio/maven/flatbuffer-gradle-plugin/_latestVersion) and can be used as follows:

Gradle:

```
repositories {
    maven {
        url  "http://dl.bintray.com/ragdroid/maven" 
    }
}
dependencies {
        classpath 'in.co.ophio:flatbuffer-gradle-plugin:0.1.0'
    }
    
```
To apply the plugin: `apply plugin: 'flatbuffer-gradle-plugin'`

Use the `flatbuffer` closure as follows :

```
flatbuffer {
    flatcPath = "${project.rootDir}"  // (optional, default location project root directory)
    inputFileName = "schema.fbs" 
   inputFilePath = ""${project.rootDir}"" // (optional, default location project root directory)
    outputDirPath = "${projectDir}/src/main/java"
}
```

* `flatcPath`: (optional, defaults to the project root Directory) path to the **flatc** executable.
* `inputFilePath`: (optional, defaults to the project root Directory) path to input schema file.
* `inputFileName`: name of your input schema file
* `outputDirPath`: directory where you want your java classes to get generated.

## Uploading the plugin:

Upload on **maven** local :

```
cd plugin; ../gradlew clean uploadArchives
```

Upload on **bintray** (assuming you have a `bintray.properties` file in the `{rootDirectory}/plugin` directory) : 

```
cd plugin; ../gradlew clean build bintrayUpload
```
